\caption{Path locality in EVM execution exhibits an extreme Pareto 
distribution. Measured across 5,000 mainnet blocks, the top 1\% of unique 
paths account for 70\% of all frame executions, the top 5\% handle 85\%, 
and the top 10\% handle 93\%. The shaded region illustrates the deviation 
from uniform distribution, demonstrating extreme concentration that enables 
efficient frame-level caching with minimal storage overhead.}
