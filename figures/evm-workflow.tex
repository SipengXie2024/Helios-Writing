\caption{The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution workflow. The process is partitioned into a high-level frame management lifecycle (left) and a low-level, per-opcode execution loop (right). The diagram illustrates the interaction between the runtime stack, volatile memory, and persistent storage, along with the standard hook events utilized by Helios for non-invasive tracing.}
