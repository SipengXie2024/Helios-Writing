Smart contract execution remains a primary scalability bottleneck for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains. Existing optimization strategies, such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and path-driven speculative execution, face a "performance paradox" where the overhead of detailed tracing and artifact management often negates performance gains on modern, highly optimized clients like Revm. We present \textbf{Helios}, a path-driven execution engine designed to resolve this trade-off through lightweight asynchronous tracing and persistent frame-level caching. Unlike transaction-level approaches, Helios exploits the strong path locality of individual contract calls to maximize reuse across different transactions, transforming raw traces into Static Single Assignment (SSA) graphs off the critical path. By restricting optimization to static-cost instructions, the system guarantees gas-semantic equivalence by construction, eliminating the economic risks associated with aggressive compilation. Evaluation on Ethereum mainnet workloads demonstrates that Helios achieves a median speedup of 6.60$\times$ over the state-of-the-art client Revm in Replay Mode, making it ideal for archive node acceleration. In Online Mode, frequency-based filtering enables effective acceleration of hot paths with negligible storage overhead. These findings establish Helios as a scalable, safe foundation for next-generation EVM infrastructure.
