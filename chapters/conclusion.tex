\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented Helios, a path-driven execution engine that accelerates EVM transaction processing while preserving gas-semantic correctness. On modern interpreters such as Revm, instrumentation and artifact management costs often exceed native execution latency, creating an \textit{optimization dilemma}. Helios addresses this through \textit{hybrid execution} that restricts optimization to static-cost instructions, \textit{asynchronous tracing} that decouples profiling from the critical path, and \textit{frame-level caching} that exploits Pareto-like call locality while resisting cache-flooding attacks. The resulting SSA graphs are executed by a guarded register-based interpreter, where runtime control-flow guards ensure correctness by triggering native fallback upon path divergence.

Evaluation on Ethereum mainnet demonstrates the effectiveness of this design: Helios achieves 6.60$\times$ median speedup in Replay Mode and 2.05$\times$ in Online Mode with 4.9\% storage overhead. Future work will explore two directions. First, selective JIT compilation for hot paths may further reduce interpretation overhead beyond what the register-based model achieves. Second, frame-level fallback mechanisms that checkpoint at call boundaries could improve Online Mode coverage by avoiding full transaction rollback on mispredictions. By decoupling optimization from the critical path, Helios offers a foundation for scalable EVM infrastructure.
