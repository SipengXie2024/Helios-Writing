\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented Helios, a path-driven execution engine that accelerates EVM transaction processing while preserving gas-semantic correctness. On modern interpreters such as Revm, instrumentation and artifact management costs often exceed native execution latency, creating an \textit{optimization dilemma}. Helios addresses this through \textit{hybrid execution} that restricts optimization to static-cost instructions, \textit{asynchronous tracing} that decouples profiling from the critical path, and \textit{frame-level caching} that exploits Pareto-like call locality while resisting cache-flooding attacks. The resulting SSA graphs are executed by a guarded register-based interpreter, where runtime control-flow guards ensure correctness by triggering native fallback upon path divergence.

Helios advances the state of the art along four dimensions. The hybrid execution model and chunked gas accounting help preserve \textit{safety} by maintaining bit-level equivalence with canonical EVM semantics. Asynchronous tracing and direct-access register files contribute to \textit{efficiency} by removing instrumentation and stack manipulation from the critical path. Frequency-based filtering and bounded resource allocation provide \textit{robustness} against adversarial path explosion. The dual-mode architecture demonstrates \textit{versatility} by serving both latency-sensitive validators and throughput-oriented archive nodes from a unified artifact set.

Evaluation on Ethereum mainnet supports the effectiveness of this design: Helios achieves 6.60$\times$ median speedup in Replay Mode and 2.05$\times$ in Online Mode with 4.9\% storage overhead. Future work will explore two directions. First, selective JIT compilation for hot paths may further reduce interpretation overhead beyond what the register-based model achieves. Second, frame-level fallback mechanisms that checkpoint at call boundaries could improve Online Mode coverage by avoiding full transaction rollback on mispredictions. By decoupling optimization from the critical path, Helios offers a foundation for scalable EVM infrastructure.
